# Poisoning & Narcotics Overdose

Proper treatment and swift response are critical when dealing with overdoses or toxic ingestion. Stabilise first, then support recovery.

---

## Opioid Overdose

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Unresponsiveness or altered consciousness
- Slow, shallow, or absent breathing
- Pinpoint pupils (miosis)
- Blue or pale lips/nails (hypoxia)

**Treatment Steps:**
1. **Assess vitals immediately**
2. **Administer Naloxone (Narcan)** intranasally or via injection
3. Monitor response:
   - Breathing should resume within minutes
   - Consciousness may improve gradually
4. If minimal or no response, **repeat Narcan dose** every 2–3 minutes as needed
5. Start **Oxygen support** if respiratory depression is severe
6. Administer a **Banana Bag** (IV fluids + vitamins) to aid metabolic recovery
7. Continue monitoring until fully alert or stable enough for discharge or handoff

> Narcan has a short half-life — patients may need repeat dosing or observation for rebound symptoms.

## Poisoning

**Common Symptoms of Ingestion or Exposure:**
- Nausea & vomiting
- Abdominal cramping or pain
- Excessive salivation or sweating
- Dizziness or confusion
- Seizures or cardiac irregularities (in severe cases)

**Treatment Steps:**
1. Quickly **identify the suspected poison or source**
   - Ask about recent food, drink, medications, or substances
2. **Administer Activated Charcoal** (if appropriate and patient is conscious)
   - Helps bind poison in GI tract to prevent absorption
   - May induce nausea or vomiting as side effect
3. Provide **emesis container** and monitor patient closely
4. Track **vital signs** and watch for deterioration
5. Start a **Banana Bag** IV to restore hydration, electrolytes, and essential vitamins
6. If source is known and time-sensitive (e.g., antifreeze, bleach, etc.), consult poison-specific antidote protocols

> Optional RP Element: Have the lab analyse vomit or blood samples to confirm toxin if needed for storyline or realism.

**Notes:**
- Always prioritize airway and breathing in any suspected overdose or poisoning
- Never induce vomiting unless directed or appropriate
- Escalate to ICU-level care if patient condition worsens or if unknown substances were involved
