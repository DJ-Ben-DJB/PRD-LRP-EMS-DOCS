# EMS Roleplay Guide for Patients

## How to Roleplay a Patient Effectively in EMS Scenes

When you roleplay a patient, your goal is to:
- Give EMS something meaningful to respond to.
- Keep your injuries consistent.
- Avoid magically healing.
- Create good story progression for yourself and others.

---

## General Tips for Patients

- Be clear, but not well-informed
You wouldn’t know the exact medical diagnosis. Instead of saying:
`I have a fractured right tibia.`
Say:
`My lower right leg hurts like hell, I can’t put weight on it.`

- Give symptoms, not solutions
EMS decides the treatment; you describe how you feel.

- Stay consistent, If you were shot in the leg, don’t sprint away five minutes later.

- RP your pain level - Mild → Moderate → Severe - Use breathing, groaning, inability to stand, or confusion.

- Be responsive to roleplay, Let EMS examine you. Don’t rush scenes, medical scenes are story moments

- Use emotions: fear, confusion, shock, relief.

- Keep injuries believable but interesting.

- Let EMS shine, their job is more fun when patients react realistically.
