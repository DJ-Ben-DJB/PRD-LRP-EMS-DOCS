## Basic Medical Assessment (BMA) – Trainee First Response Evaluation

This assessment is designed to evaluate how a Trainee EMS handles common, low-complexity medical scenarios. It is a required step before a trainee can be promoted to EMT.

### Assessment Overview

The assigned Assessor (a senior or supervisory EMS staff member) will present two scenarios from the list below. Scenarios can be described verbally or enhanced with props or other members of the EMS Staff, depending on preference and available resources:
- First-degree burns
- Closed fracture (arm or leg)
- Severe asthma attack
- Shallow laceration (e.g. knife slash or gash)

### Trainee Expectations
The trainee must:
- Confidently explain their approach to assessing the patient.
- Describe appropriate treatment, including:
  - Which medical tools or supplies they would use.
  - How they would stabilise the patient.
  - Whether or not transport to Pillbox Hill Medical is required.
- Demonstrate awareness of scene safety, patient communication, and EMS procedure.

### Assessment Criteria
The Assessor should evaluate the trainee on:
- Scene Management – Maintaining control, ensuring safety, and delegating where necessary.
- Level of Care – Proper use of medical protocol and attention to patient wellbeing.
- Confidence & Communication – Showing clear, calm decision-making and professionalism throughout the scenario.

### Post-Assessment
If the trainee passes the Basic Medical Assessment, they will be promoted to EMT. With continued field performance, professionalism, and consistent duty activity, they may later be promoted.

## Intermediate Medical Assessment (IMA) – EMT Evaluation

This assessment is designed to evaluate how Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and Hospital Nurses manage intermediate-level medical situations with emerging complexity. It marks a crucial step toward progression to Paramedic (field track) or Doctor (hospital track).

Both EMTs and Nurses must demonstrate the ability to:
- Manage care independently in moderately complex scenarios
- Recognise complications beyond surface-level injuries
- Make confident decisions about treatment, escalation, and patient flow

Passing this assessment confirms that the candidate is ready for greater responsibility and specialisation within the EMS or Hospital team.

### Assessment Overview

The Assessor will present two patient scenarios, each involving:
- A clear primary injury, and
- A potential secondary complication requiring clinical judgment

Props may be used to enhance realism, but clear verbal descriptions are sufficient.

**Select two scenarios from the following:**
- Broken jaw with potential concussion
- Stab wound with suspected internal bleeding
- Open limb fracture with possible joint dislocation
- Gunshot wound with potential organ damage (Assessor’s choice)

### Candidate Expectations

Whether you're assessing an EMT or a Nurse, both must be able to:
- Explain their treatment plan for the obvious injury
- Identify signs of possible complications and describe how they would:
  - Diagnose the issue
  - Treat or stabilise the patient
  - Decide on escalation (e.g., surgeon, trauma team, or advanced transport)
- Determine transport/transfer method:
  - EMTs: Describe ambulance setup, patient handling, and Code call

### Role-Specific Guidelines

**EMTs (First Response)**
- Manage care until hospital handover
- Use EMS kits effectively, maintain scene safety, and communicate clearly via radio/MDT
- Demonstrate awareness of transport priorities and basic triage

**Nurses (Hospital Role)**
- Provide bedside care using hospital resources
- Coordinate with doctors, surgeons, and other internal departments
- Take vital signs, initiate IVs, prep for imaging or surgery where needed

### Assessment Criteria

Assessors should evaluate the candidate on:
- Medical Knowledge – Accuracy of assessment, treatment choices, and triage
- Confidence – Clear communication and professional decision-making
- Adaptability – Ability to adjust approach when complications arise
- Care Management – Proper handling of equipment, patient interaction, and documentation

### Outcome
If **Failed**: Provide constructive feedback and recommend further reading or shadowing. The candidate should wait at least 1 week before reattempting.
If **Passed**: Mark the candidate as certified at the Intermediate level, eligible for promotion.

## Advanced Medical Assessment (AMA) - Paramedic Evaluation

The Advanced Medical Assessment (AMA) is the final step in the professional development of senior EMS and Hospital personnel. It is designed to evaluate a candidate's leadership, clinical judgment, scene coordination, and readiness to take on supervisory responsibilities within their respective roles.

### Assessment Context

This is a high-stakes evaluation scenario where the candidate must manage a critical multi-patient scene involving:
- Two unconscious suspects (10-15s) with serious GSWs, restrained and incapacitated
- One conscious Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) with a less severe injury (e.g., GSW to limb)
- Coordination with at least one agency: LSPD, SADB, or BCSO

The assessment should be staged in a controlled location away from civilian RP areas to ensure immersion and focus.

### Candidate Objectives

Whether a Paramedic or Doctor, the candidate must demonstrate the following:

**Scene Management & Leadership**
  - Secure the scene with LEO cooperation
  - Maintain control and authority without escalating tensions
  - Assign roles or direct available EMS/Hospital staff (if present)
  - Communicate effectively with dispatch, other units, and law enforcement

**Triage and Medical Care**
  - Accurately assess each patient and assign treatment priority
  - Clearly explain treatment plans for all patients, including complications
  - Manage hypotheticals: “If you were the only responder, how would you treat and transport these patients with LEO assistance?”

**Operational Communication**
  - Execute a proper CODE 1 or equivalent call
  - Provide organised updates via radio and/or MDT
  - Maintain professionalism under pressure

### Role-Specific Guidelines

## Air Rescue - Flight Assessment Certification (ARC)

The Air Rescue Certification is designed to ensure EMS personnel are fully prepared to operate **ANGEL-1**, our dedicated medical response helicopter. This assessment covers **flight safety**, **emergency procedures**, and **practical landing skills** in challenging environments.

Only those holding the rank of **Paramedic or above** may begin this course, as it involves handling one of the most **specialised and high-risk** roles within EMS.

Successful completion certifies the trainee for Air Rescue operations, pending final deployment approval by senior staff.

### Orientation & Flight Safety Briefing

Before takeoff, the assessor must provide a safety overview covering essential aspects of helicopter operations:

**Helicopter Safety Protocols:**
- Pilots must wear **secure clothing and footwear**. Avoid loose garments that could interfere with rotor mechanisms or harnesses in emergencies.
- Approach the helicopter from the **front or side**, **never from behind** the tail rotor.
- All crew and passengers must remain at a safe distance until the pilot gives clearance to board.

### ANGEL-1 Operational Guidelines

When considering deployment of ANGEL-1 (Air Rescue Helicopter), trainees must be trained to evaluate the situation with the following in mind:
- **Urgency**: Is the patient in **critical condition** and located in an area where ground access would be significantly delayed?
- **Location**: Is the patient in a **remote or inaccessible location**, such as an island, mountain, or rugged off-road terrain?
- **Authorisation**: Has the pilot received **supervisor clearance** for **ANGEL-1** deployment? Unauthorised use is strictly prohibited.
- **Purpose**: ANGEL-1 is **not a convenience transport**. It is a costly emergency response unit and must be used responsibly.

### Emergency Landing / Imminent Crash:

- Identify and aim for a **safe landing zone**, away from populated areas.
- Transmit a **Mayday call** with your location and intended course of action to alert all relevant emergency services.
- If control is maintained, **use autorotation** to reduce impact severity.
- Upon landing (if engine is still running), **cut power**, reduce **throttle to zero**, and secure the landing zone.
- Assess and treat **crew and passengers** for any injuries.

### Under Attack / Small Arms Fire:

- **Immediately report** the threat to Law Enforcement and EMS dispatch.
- If the source is visible and flight remains viable, **evade and retreat** at best speed.
- If the threat is unclear or the aircraft is compromised, **initiate emergency landing procedures** as outlined above.

### Passenger Flight Controls (Infrared and Search Lights)

In addition, the use of the EMS Chopper Cam and Night vision will also be discussed:
- **'E'**- Use Cam as passenger
- **'Space'** - Lock on to vehicles (alt approx 100 ft)
- **'RMB'** *Right Mouse Button* - Switch modes (Day, Night, Heat)
- **'G'** - Spotlight

## Part 1 (ARC) - Flight Test – Practical Evaluation

### Instructions

The trainee will take off in **ANGEL-1** from **Pillbox Heli-pad**, ascending to a minimum altitude of **200-400 ft AGL**. They must safely navigate to and land at the following locations:
- **Maze Bank Tower**
- **Richards Majestic** (7226)
- Then return to **Pillbox**

<figure class="image"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DJ-Ben-DJB/PRD-LRP-EMS-DOCS/main/assets/images/vehicle/arc1p1.jpg"></figure>
