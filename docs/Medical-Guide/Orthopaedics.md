# ðŸ¦´ Fractures

Fractures, or broken bones, vary in severity and treatment depending on alignment, location, and involvement of nearby tissues. Proper assessment and stabilisation are key to recovery and pain management.

---

## Non-Displaced Fracture

A **non-displaced fracture** occurs when the bone is broken, but the two ends remain properly aligned. These fractures generally heal well with immobilisation and conservative care.

### Treatment
- Administer **pain relief medication** as needed
- Apply **ice** to reduce swelling and pain
- Immobilise the limb with a **cast**, if applicable
  - **Ribs** are *not castable*; allow to heal naturally
  - **Spine and Skull** require specialised fixation; casting not possible
- Use **UV curing** (e.g., with `/e weld`) to harden casts if applicable

*Patients can typically be discharged after stabilisation with follow-up instructions.*

## Displaced Fracture (Non-Skull)

A **displaced fracture** means the bone fragments are misaligned and must be realigned (reduced) before healing can occur.

### Initial Care
- Provide **pain relief** and **ice** for swelling
- Evaluate if reduction can be performed **non-surgically** or if **surgical intervention** is required

---

### Non-Surgical Realignment
- **Manually reduce** the fracture through physical manipulation (pulling, rotating, or pushing limbs to re-align)
- Confirm alignment with **repeat imaging**
- Once aligned, **cast** the limb for immobilisation

---

### Surgical Realignment
Required when closed reduction fails or the injury is complex.

#### Procedure:
- **Sedate and intubate** the patient, or administer a **local nerve block** if appropriate
- Make a **clean incision** over the affected area
- Irrigate with **saline and bacitracin** to reduce infection risk
- Use **suction** to clear the surgical field
- **Align bone fragments** and **fixate** using:
  - **Plates, screws, rods, or pins**
- Re-irrigate and clear the area
- **Close the wound**, apply **antibiotic ointment**, and cover with **sterile gauze**
- Apply a **removable cast** if wound access is necessary for follow-up care

Notes:
- **Spinal fractures** require surgical fixationâ€”*no casting*
- **Rib fractures** heal naturally with time and pain management

---

## Skull Fracture

A **skull fracture** is a serious injury where the cranial bones are compromised. These are categorized by whether the bone is **depressed** or **linear**.

---

### Non-Surgical Skull Fracture (Linear)

Occurs when the skull is cracked but the bone remains in place.

- Confirm with **CT or X-ray imaging**
- Monitor for signs of:
  - **Intracranial bleeding**
  - **Swelling**
  - **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**
- If **no signs of complications**, no surgical intervention is needed
- Provide **pain management**
- Patient may resume normal activity within several days
- Refer to [Neurological] section if TBI is suspected

---

### Surgical Skull Fracture (Depressed)

Occurs when a portion of the skull is sunken inward, potentially compressing the brain.

#### Procedure:
- **Sedate and intubate** the patient
- Make a **large incision** to access the fracture
- Irrigate with **saline and bacitracin**
- Use **suction** to maintain visibility
- **Lift and realign** bone fragments
  - Use **plates, pins, or synthetic material** as needed
- If the brain is swollen:
  - **Delay reconstruction** to allow for decompression
  - Store bone flap under scalp or discard and replace in follow-up
- Re-irrigate and clear the surgical field
- **Close wound**, apply **ointment**, and cover with **sterile gauze**

Post-op monitoring for neurological function and intracranial pressure is essential. May require **ICU stay** or **protective helmet** if bone repair is delayed.

*Fractures of any type should always be documented with imaging, treated promptly, and followed by recovery instructions to avoid long-term complications.*
