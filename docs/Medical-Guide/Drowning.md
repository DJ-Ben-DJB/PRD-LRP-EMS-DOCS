# Drowning

---

## On Scene  
Helping someone who’s drowned — act fast and follow these steps.

### What To Do:
1. **Roll the patient onto their side.**
   - This helps them cough up water.
2. **Pat their back** gently to encourage coughing.
3. **Once they cough up water, lay them on their back again.**
4. **Check their vitals** (pulse, breathing).
5. **If no pulse, begin CPR:**
   - 2 rounds of **30 chest compressions** and **2 rescue breaths**.
   - Check if the pulse comes back.
6. **If still no pulse, use an AED (defibrillator):**
   - Cut off the shirt if needed.
   - Dry off their chest completely.
   - Place AED pads on the dry skin.
   - Turn on AED and follow prompts.
     - If AED says “shock advised,” press the shock button.
7. **If not revived after 1st shock:**
   - Give **Epinephrine (Epi)**.
   - You can **shock up to 3 times total**.
8. **Once they have a pulse, put on an oxygen mask.**
9. **Start an IV and give Lasix** (if they drowned in saltwater).
10. **Transport the patient to the hospital.**

## In the Hospital  
Now that the patient’s at the hospital, keep supporting their breathing and check for damage.

### What To Do:
1. **Check the basics (ABCs):**
   - Airway: Is it open?
   - Breathing: Are they breathing well?
   - Circulation: Is their pulse stable?
2. **Stabilize the patient** as needed.
3. **If they stop breathing**, intubate (tube in throat) and use a ventilator.
4. **Give high-flow oxygen** to improve their oxygen levels.
5. **Do a chest X-ray** to look for fluid or lung damage.
   - **If fluid in windpipe:** Use a hollow needle to drain it.
   - **If fluid in lungs:** Give a **diuretic** (to remove fluid) and **antibiotics** (to prevent infection).
6. **Once stable, move the patient to recovery.**
