# EMS Roleplay Guide for Patients in Surgery

---
## Before Going Into Surgery

Use these while being prepped or sedated:

`I’m really nervous… is everything going to be okay?`

`My chest feels tight… I’m scared.`

`I feel lightheaded from whatever you gave me.`

`Everything’s starting to get blurry…`

`I can hear you, but it feels distant.`

`My body feels heavy… like I can’t move.`



---

## During Anesthesia (Fading Out)

Before you fully ‘go under’:

`I’m… feeling… really sleepy…`

`My arms feel numb…`

`It’s getting harder to… stay awake…`

`Are… you… still… there…?`

Behaviors:

- Soft mumbling or incoherent speech

- Eyes fluttering or rolling closed

- Once unconscious, you should remain unresponsive:

- No movement unless directed through /me

- No speech

- No sudden “waking up” unless prompted

---

## While Under Surgery (Unconscious RP)

- You won’t talk, but you can let EMS prompt responses:

- Passive cues you can emote with:

`/me has shallow breathing under anesthesia.`

`/me body remains limp and unresponsive.`

`/me shows no reaction to incision.`

`/me vitals remain stable on monitors.`

(Only use vitals if EMS announces them first, you shouldn’t self-diagnose.)

## Waking Up From Surgery

This part is great for RP—groggy, confused, disoriented:

Phrases:

`Wh… where am I?`

`Everything feels… heavy.`

`My throat hurts… why does it hurt?`

`I feel nauseous…`

`What happened…? Did it go okay?`

`My vision is blurry…`

`Can I move? It feels weird…`


Behaviors:

- Slow movements

- Groggy blinking

- Trying to sit up but struggling

- Slurred words

- Mild confusion or memory gaps

---

## Post-Surgery RP (Recovery Room)

You can continue with:

`I’m sore… everything aches.`

`I feel weak, like I ran a marathon.`

`Is it normal to feel this tired?`

`It hurts if I move too much.`

`Can I get some water? My mouth is dry.`
