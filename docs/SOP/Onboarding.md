# EMS Onboarding 

As a member of this department, your role extends beyond saving lives. You’re now shaping the ones who will stand beside you in the field. This handbook is designed to equip you with the tools, techniques, and expectations necessary to train the next generation of EMS professionals.
You know the job: it’s fast, unforgiving, and doesn’t wait for anyone to catch up. That’s why we rely on leaders like you to pass on more than just procedure. We need you to pass on discipline, resilience, and the unshakable calm that only experience can teach.
Inside this book, you’ll find structured training modules, field scenarios, mentoring strategies, and the core values we expect every recruit to carry into their first response and every one after. You’ll also find guidelines on evaluating performance, delivering feedback, and knowing when a trainee is truly ready.
Your legacy isn’t just in the lives you save, it's in the medics you train to save even more.
Let’s build a team this city can count on.

## Recruits First Day

Once an applicant has been hired and added to our EMS MDT system, it is the responsibility of the interviewer, or another available senior staff member, to provide them with a proper tour of Pillbox Hospital. This tour ensures the new hire is familiar with key areas and systems before beginning active duty.

During the tour, make sure to cover the following:
- Clocking In/Out: Show them where and how to clock on and off duty.
- Changing Room: Help them get changed and set up with their first uniform.
- Supply Cupboard: Show them where first aid supplies are kept. Ensure they are equipped with basic medical gear and explain how to use both the equipment and our inventory systems.
- Hospital Layout: Walk them through the key areas including:
  - Progressive Care Unit (PCU)
  - Operating Block and MRI area
  - Staff lounge and locker area
  - The general wards
  - Garage Access: Show them the vehicle garage where ambulances are kept. Explain parking protocols.
  - MDT Training: Familiarise them with the Mobile Data Terminal, setting up their profile, accessing and submitting reports, and how to respond to active calls.

### Assessing Experience

If you were not the original interviewer, take this time to get to know the new hire. Ask about their medical background, past experience, and comfort level with the systems. This will help you tailor their training appropriately.

### First Shift Expectations

Unless the new hire has verified medical experience, they should not be sent out alone on their first shift. Instead, they should:
- Ride along with an EMT/Paramedic, senior, or tenured staff member.
- Assist on calls where appropriate.
- Observe any surgeries or advanced procedures.
- Study the EMS Handbook, Injury Evaluation Guides, and other key documents.

> If the lead is comfortable, allow the trainee to drive the ambulance during non-emergency situations to assess their vehicle handling.

### Post-Training Evaluation

At the end of the first shift:
- If the trainee has demonstrated basic competence, they can be cleared for solo shifts.
- Encourage continued collaboration with senior staff, and ongoing learning.
- If multiple new hires have started together, they may buddy up to support each other especially if their strengths and knowledge differ.

Once the trainee has:
- Spent a reasonable amount of time on duty,
- Responded to calls both solo and alongside other team members, and
- Shown consistent grasp of essential EMS skills,
They may be put forward for the Basic Medical Assessment. the first of three evaluations used to determine skill competency and eligibility for future promotion.
