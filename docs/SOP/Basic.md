## EMS Training & Progression Summary

This EMS development model outlines a structured, tiered progression for emergency medical staff, divided into two primary career paths: the Hospital Track and the First Response Track. Each track consists of four progressive levels (G-1 to G-4), designed to build essential skills, deepen medical knowledge, and develop leadership capabilities.

### Hospital Track (G-1 to G-4)
This track prepares staff for in-hospital patient care and leadership in medical facility settings.

**G-1: Trainee Nurse**
- Entry-level training focused on basic patient care, hospital workflows, vital signs, hygiene, and basic documentation. Trainees shadow senior nurses and gain initial exposure to medications and IV preparation.

**G-2: Nurse**
- Nurses learn to administer medications, manage patient documentation, assist in triage, and support doctors in procedures. Training emphasizes communication, charting accuracy, and conflict resolution.

**G-3: Doctor**
- Doctors develop diagnostic and treatment skills, perform minor procedures, and coordinate closely with nurses and EMTs. They are trained in emergency response and case handovers within the hospital.

**G-4: Hospital Supervisor**
- Supervisors oversee hospital operations, manage staff schedules, resolve conflicts, and lead triage during high-pressure events. Leadership development, staff mentoring, and communication with EMS teams are key focuses.

### First Response Track (G-1 to G-4)
This track equips EMS personnel to operate in the field, respond to emergencies, and take command at incident scenes.

**G-1: Trainee EMT**
- Trainees learn scene safety, basic triage, CPR, and first aid. They are introduced to EMT equipment, communication protocols, and gain field experience through supervised ride-alongs.

**G-2: Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)**
- EMTs build on foundational skills by learning to administer basic medications, assess patients in the field, and manage transport to hospitals. They handle real-world trauma and medical call scenarios.

**G-3: Paramedic**
- Paramedics receive advanced training in life support, airway management, cardiac monitoring, and critical care transport. They lead at complex scenes and manage multi-casualty incidents.

**G-4: First Response Supervisor**
- Supervisors coordinate EMS field teams, interface with police/fire services, lead debriefings, and mentor EMTs and paramedics. Training includes leadership simulations and evaluations of critical scenes.

### Role Progression Criteria
Staff must spend a minimum of 3 months in each grade level, actively participating and demonstrating role proficiency through performance evaluations and practical assessments.
