# Handling Deceased / Permadeathed Characters

As a member of EMS, your role is not only to save lives but also to handle death with professionalism and respect. When a player decides to permadeath (perma) their character, your job shifts from life-saving to documenting the death, preserving roleplay, and helping provide closure.

This guide outlines the correct procedures to follow when encountering a permadeathed or deceased character.

## At Scene Care  
Upon arrival at the scene:

- Ensure Scene Safety: Make sure law enforcement has cleared the area if it was a crime or active shooter scene.
- Assess the Situation: Check for signs of life (pulse, breathing, responsiveness).
   - If no vital signs are detected and it's clear the character is beyond revival, move to Step 2.
   - If the player uses '/me' or OOC chat to indicate a permadeath (e.g., '/me has passed away permanently'), confirm that this is a permadeath and proceed.

## Confirm Permadeath

Verify OOCly if Needed:

- Use '/me' or dm them on discord to confirm:
**"/me Would patient be resuscitated?"**

If confirmed:

- Treat the character as legally deceased.
- Notify any law enforcement on the scene that the person is deceased.

> Note: **Do not** revive a permadeathed character under any circumstances. **Do not** joke or go OOC in an insensitive way at the scene. **Do not** leave the scene without proper RP documentation of death and body removal.

## Report 

Begin documenting the death for RP records:

'/me kneels beside the body and checks for vitals.'

'/me No pulse or breathing detected.'

'/me confirms time of death at [in-game time].'

'/me places a sheet over the body and calls for a coroner.'

Include as much detail as possible in an EMS report in the MDT

Fill out a Death Report including:

- Character name
- Time of death
- EMS units on scene
- Summary of injuries
- Cause of death (if known)
- Actions taken

## Transport

There are two main ways to proceed

### Option 1: Coroner RP / Morgue
- Contact the coroner (if available).
- Transport the body to the morgue or hospital if coroners are not available.
- Use '/me' to show covering and loading the body onto a stretcher or body bag.

### Option 2: Law Enforcement Hand-off
- If the death is part of a criminal investigation, hand the body over to law enforcement or CSI.
- Remain on-scene to assist with any statements or medical insight.
