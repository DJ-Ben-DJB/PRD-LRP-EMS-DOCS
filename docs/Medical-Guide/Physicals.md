# Checkup & Physicals

Physicals are a routine part of onboarding and general health maintenance. These may be required for police before active duty.

**Please conduct exams in one of the dedicated exam rooms** - for privacy and immersion.

2. Ask them to read down the chart
3. **Passing Line**: Must read down to **Line 8** clearly

## Hearing Test

Conduct a basic tone-perception test:

1. Place headphones on the patient
2. Play a continuous tone starting around **1.5 kHz**
3. Slowly increase the tone toward **12‚Äì15 kHz**
4. A patient must perceive a tone at or above **8 kHz** to pass
