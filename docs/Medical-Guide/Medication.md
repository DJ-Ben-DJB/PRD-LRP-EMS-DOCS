## Analgesics (Painkillers)

Used to relieve pain and reduce fever. Painkillers fall into two broad categories—non-narcotic for mild to moderate pain, and narcotic for severe pain.

### Mild Pain (Pain Score 1–3)
Best for minor injuries, headaches, and fevers.
- **Acetaminophen / Paracetamol (Tylenol)** – Not an NSAID, gentle on the stomach.
- **Ibuprofen (Motrin)** – NSAID; reduces inflammation.
- **Naproxen (Aleve)** – NSAID; longer lasting than ibuprofen.

### Moderate Pain (Pain Score 4–6)
Often used post-injury or post-op.
- **Tramadol (Ultram)** – Mild opioid.
- **Acetaminophen + Codeine (Tylenol-3/Vopac)**
- **Oxycodone + Acetaminophen (Percocet)**
- **Hydrocodone + Acetaminophen (Vicodin)**

### Severe Pain (Pain Score 7–10)
Used in major trauma, post-surgical recovery, or palliative care.
- **Morphine** – Classic, powerful opioid.
- **Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)** – More potent than morphine.

*Always assess pain level carefully, and be cautious with narcotic requests, especially if a patient asks for them early on.*

- **Vancomycin (Vancocin)** – Strong non-penicillin antibiotic.
- **Sulfamethoxazole + Trimethoprim (Bactrim)** – Good for penicillin-allergic patients.

### Antivirals (For Viral Infections)
For flu, shingles, and respiratory viruses.
- **Acyclovir (Zovirax)**

- **Ritonavir (Norvir)** – Commonly used in HIV treatment.

### Antifungals (For Fungal Infections)
- **Voriconazole (Vfend)**
- **Clotrimazole (Lotrimin)** – Often topical.
- **Terbinafine (Lamisil)**

## Cardiovascular Medications

### For Hypertension (High BP)
- **Nitroglycerin** – Relieves chest pain by dilating vessels.

### For Hypotension (Low BP)
- **Fludrocortisone (Florinef)** – Helps increase blood volume and pressure.

### During Cardiac Arrest
- **Epinephrine (Adrenaline)** – Stimulates the heart.

### For Tachycardia (HR >100 bpm)
- **Diltiazem (Cardizem)** – Slows heart rate.

### For Bradycardia (HR <60 bpm)
- **Epinephrine (Adrenaline)** – Boosts heart rate temporarily.

### Coagulant (Clot Promoter)
Used to stop bleeding during trauma or surgery.
- **Tranexamic Acid (TXA)** – Promotes clotting; handle with care.

### Anticoagulants (Blood Thinners)
Makes bleeding harder to stop—be alert if trauma occurs.
- **Warfarin** – Requires monitoring and dosage checks.
- **Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)** – No routine monitoring needed.
- **Heparin** – IV use in hospitals to prevent clot formation.
