# Breathing (Respiratory)

The respiratory system is responsible for one of the most vital functions in the human body—bringing oxygen in and pushing carbon dioxide out. Every breath a patient takes affects their heart, brain, and overall function, which makes assessing respiratory status a top priority in any emergency or hospital setting.

## General Respiratory Assessment

- Check **vital signs**, including **oxygen saturation (SpO₂)**
- Administer **supplemental oxygen** as needed
- Auscultate lungs and assess for abnormal breath sounds:
  - **Wheezing** – may indicate asthma or bronchoconstriction  
  - **Crackles / Rales** – suggests fluid accumulation (e.g., pulmonary edema)  
  - **Rhonchi** – low-pitched rattling, common in mucus buildup or bronchitis  
  - **Stridor** – high-pitched crowing; upper airway obstruction  
  - **Absent breath sounds** – could indicate a collapsed lung (pneumothorax)  
  - **Labored breathing with cough** – may be a sign of pneumonia  

---

## Wheezing (Asthma / Bronchoconstriction)

- Administer a **bronchodilator** (e.g., **Albuterol** via inhaler or nebulizer)
- Monitor **SpO₂** and respiratory rate
- Recommend **home nebulizer treatment**
- Discuss **asthma action plan** or trigger avoidance
- Discharge with **medications** and **follow-up plan**

---

## Fluid in Lungs / Drowning (Pulmonary Edema or Near-Drowning)

- Elevate the **head of bed** (Fowler’s position) to ease breathing
- Administer a **diuretic** (e.g., Furosemide) to reduce fluid overload
- Continuously monitor **vital signs** and **oxygen saturation**
- Continue oxygen therapy and other supportive measures as needed

---

## Bronchitis

- Provide symptom relief:
  - **Cough suppressant** (e.g., Dextromethorphan)  
  - **Expectorant** (e.g., Guaifenesin)  
- Administer a **bronchodilator** (e.g., Albuterol)
- Encourage **fluid intake**
  - Offer **oral fluids** or administer **IV saline**
- Monitor **oxygen saturation** and vitals
- Discharge with **home care instructions**:
  - Rest, hydration, and prescribed medications

---

## Upper Airway Obstruction

- Perform a **head-tilt chin-lift** to open airway
- Visually inspect the airway for obstruction
- If blockage is visible, attempt to remove it manually
- If needed, perform:
  - **Back blows**
  - **Heimlich maneuver**
- Administer **oxygen** once airway is cleared
- Monitor **vitals**
- Discharge when patient is stable

---

## Collapsed Lung (Pneumothorax)

- Administer **high-flow oxygen**
- Assess **vital signs** and respiratory effort
- Prepare and assist with **chest tube placement**
- Remove **air or fluid** from pleural space to re-expand the lung
- Monitor for **improved breath sounds**
- Provide **pain management** as needed
- Remove tube once lung function is normalized
- Discharge when stable

---

## Pneumonia

**Symptoms:** Cough, Difficulty Breathing, Chest Pain, Fever, Fatigue

- Order a **chest X-ray** for diagnosis
- Administer **antibiotics** as indicated
- Provide symptom relief:
  - **NSAIDs** for fever and discomfort  
  - **Cough suppressant**  
  - **Expectorant**  
- Provide **oxygen** if SpO₂ is low
- Encourage **fluid intake** (oral or IV)
- Monitor **vitals** and **respiratory status**
