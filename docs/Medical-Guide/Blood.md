# Overview: Blood Type Compatibility

---

Human blood types are determined by the ABO system and the Rh factor. These classifications are critical for safe blood transfusions because incompatible blood can trigger dangerous immune reactions.

---

## ABO Blood Group System

The ABO system classifies blood based on the presence of antigens on red blood cells:
- Type A: Has A antigens
- Type B: Has B antigens
- Type AB: Has both A and B antigens
- Type O: Has no A or B antigens

The immune system produces antibodies against antigens that are not present in the person’s own blood.

---

## Rh Factor (+ / −)

The Rh factor refers to the presence of the Rh (D) antigen:
- Rh-positive (+): Rh antigen present
- Rh-negative (−): Rh antigen absent

Rh-negative individuals should not receive Rh-positive blood, as it may cause an immune response.

---

## Donor Compatibility

Compatibility depends on avoiding antigens that the recipient’s immune system would attack.

Key principles:
- O−: Universal red blood cell donor
- AB+: Can only donate to AB+
- Rh-negative blood can be given to both Rh− and Rh+ recipients
- Rh-positive blood can only be given to Rh+ recipients

---

## Recipient Compatibility

Recipients must avoid donor antigens that their immune system recognises as foreign.

Key principles:
- AB+: Universal red blood cell recipient
- O−: Can only receive from O−
- Rh-positive recipients can receive Rh+ or Rh−
- Rh-negative recipients should receive only Rh−

---

## Why Compatibility Matters

Transfusing incompatible blood can cause:
- Clumping of red blood cells (ag- glutination)
- Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)
- Shock, organ failure, or death

Proper blood typing and crossmatching prevent these complications.
