# Medical Imagery

Medical imagery is the window into the body when the outside doesn’t tell the full story. Whether you're ruling out fractures, spotting internal bleeding, or confirming a collapsed lung, imaging helps translate symptoms into visible evidence.

## X-Ray  
*Basic internal pictures of bones, chest, and more using invisible rays.*

- Bring the patient to the **X-ray Room**.
- Have the patient **lay flat on the table**.
- **Put on a lead apron** to protect yourself from radiation.
- **Begin the scan** with the machine.
- **Take the image** from the machine once done.
- **Place the image on the projector** to review.
- Use **/ME** to ask the patient what the image reveals (fractures, infection, etc.).

## MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)  
*Detailed scan using magnets and radio waves—great for soft tissue, brain, spine, etc.*

- **Make sure the patient removes all metal items.**
- Move them to the **MRI/CT Room**.
- Lay them on the bed inside the tube-shaped scanner.
- **Tell them you’ll be in the next room** and to stay still.
- Go to the control room.
- **Begin the scan.**
- Use **/ME** to get results from the patient (e.g., brain swelling, spinal damage).
- **Move them to an exam room**, then explain your findings.

> **⚠️ DO NOT use MRI if the patient has metal implants or objects.**

## CT Scan (Computed Tomography)  
*A 3D scan showing clear cross-sections of bones, organs, and tissues.*

- Bring the patient to the **CT/MRI Room**.
- Have them **lie on the bed** inside the donut-shaped scanner.
- **Explain the procedure**, let them know you’ll be in the next room.
- Move to the control area.
- **Start the scan.**
- Use **/OOC or /ME** to get the results from the patient (e.g., internal bleeding, fractures).
- **Move the patient to an exam room**, then describe your findings based on the scan.

> *Note: The CT scanner can double as an MRI machine in RP.*

## Sonogram / Ultrasound  
*Real-time internal images using sound waves—good for soft tissues, heart, kidneys, and more.*

- Can be done **in an exam room or OR**.
- **Apply ultrasound gel** to the hand-held device (transducer).
- **Rub the transducer** over the area you're checking.
- Use it to **look for organ damage, fluid, pregnancy, etc.**
- Use **/OOC or /ME** to let the patient describe the findings.
- **Wipe off the gel** and clean the device.
- **Explain the results** to the patient.
