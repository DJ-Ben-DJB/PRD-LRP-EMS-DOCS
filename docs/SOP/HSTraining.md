## Basic Medical Assessment (BMA) - Trainee Hospital Staff Evaluation

This assessment is designed to evaluate how a Trainee of EMS Hospital Staff handle the most common medical scenarios they would encounter in Pillbox Hill Medical. It is a required step before a trainee can be promoted to Nurse

### Assessment Overview

The assigned Assessor (a senior or supervisory EMS Hospital staff member) will present two scenarios from the list below. Scenarios can be described verbally or enhanced with props or other members of the EMS staff, depending on the preference and available resources:
- Closed Fracture
- severe allergic reaction / Asthma attack
- Shallow laceration requiring sutures (e.g. knife slash or gash)
- Stomach Flu (requiring appropriate medication and IV)
- Opioid Overdose

### Trainee Expectations

The trainee must:

- Confidently explain their approach to assessing the patient.
- Describe appropriate treatment, including:
  - Which medical tools or supplies they would use.
  - Proper use of protocol and following sanitary guideline
  - Whether or not the patient would need any after care or follow up assessments

### Assessment Criteria

The assessor should evaluate the trainee on:

- Level of care - Proper use of medical protocol and attention to patient wellbeing.
- Confidence & Communication - Showing clear, calm decision-making and professionalism throughout the scenario.

###  Post-Assessment
If the trainee passes the Basic Medical Assessment, they will be promoted to Nurse. With continued field performance, professionalism, and consistent duty activity, they may later be promoted.

## Intermediate Medical Assessment (IMA) - Nurse Evaluation

This assessment is designed to evaluate how Hospital Nurses manage intermediate-level medical situations with emerging complexity. It marks a crucial step towards progression to Doctor

Nurses must demonstrate the ability to:
- Manage care independently in moderately complex scenarios
- Recognize complications beyond surface-level injuries
- Make confident decisions about treatment, escalation, and patient flow
- Have a good grasp on surgery procedure and be able to theoretically perform them independently
- Provide bedside care using hospital resources
- Coordinate with other Hospital staff and First response teams
- Take Vital signs, initiate IV's, perform imaging
- Take care if the ICU and patients staying in there

Passing this assessment confirms that the candidate is ready for greater responsibility and specialisation withing the Hospital staff.

### Assessment Overview

The Assessor will present two patient scenarios, each involving:
- A clear primary injury
- A potential secondary complication requiring clinical judgment

Props may be used to enhance realism, but clear verbal descriptions are sufficient.

**Select two scenarios from the following:**
- Broken Jaw with potential concussion
- Stab wound with suspected internal bleeding
- Open limb fracture with possible Joint dislocation
- Gunshot Wound with potential organ damage (Assessor's choice)
- Cardiac arrest triggered by severe blood loss

### Candidate Expectations

- Explain their treatment plan for both injuries
- Identify signs of possible complications and risks and how to deal with them during surgery
- Name long and short term consequences of the scenarios and how to alleviate them.
- Describe internal handover process, inter-department coordination or ICU prep

### Assessment Criteria

Assessors should evaluate the candidate on:

- Medical Knowledge - Accuracy of assessment, treatment choices and triage
- Confidence - Clear communication and professional decision-making
- Adaptability - Ability to adjust approach when complications arise
- Care Managment - Proper handling of equipment, patient interaction and documentation

### Outcome
- If **Failed**: Provide constructive feedback and recommencd further reading or shadowing. The candidate should wait at least 1 week before reattempting.
- If **Passed**: Mark the candidate as certified at the intermediate level, eligible for promotion to Doctor

## Hospital Staff Certifications

The Hospital Staff Certifications or HSC are designed to further deepen the Staffs expertise while allowing flexibility and allowing more control over who is cleared to perform high stakes surgery.

2 of these are required to advance to Doctor. Nurses who are comfortable in their role are allowed to take these, ideally these are the preperation for the IMA.

### HSC:

- Soft organ operations:
  - Learn how to operate on the liver/lungs/stomach etc. -> use skin grafts / fix a collapsed lung

- Vital organ operations:
  - Heart surgery / Brain surgery

While some of these would clear you for high risk surgery, please keep in mind that a Nurse shouldn't be performing extremely complicated surgeries unless absolutely necessary.

> The HSC are the replacement for the FR's Driving courses

## Doctor Specialisation

Once a member has reached the rank of Doctor they may choose to specialise in a field of their choice, this would require them to show unique mastery of the field in front of the High command and the Hospital Supervisor team.

Specialisations:
- Cardiac-surgeon
- Brain-surgeon
- Neuro-surgeon

The Doctor must think of a way to prove their mastery in the field in front of the Medical Committee.

If the Committee passes the Doctor they may call themselves their chosen specialisation.

If they don't, the Committee will give feedback to the Doctor, and they may retry in 2 weeks
