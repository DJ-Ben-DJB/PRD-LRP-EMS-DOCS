# Minor Cuts and Bruises

These injuries are among the most common and are typically non-life-threatening. Your job is to assess, clean, protect, and provide comfort to the patient. The key is to prevent infection, reduce swelling, and manage pain.

## At Scene Care

### Road Rash, Scrapes, and Minor Cuts
- Irrigate the wound thoroughly using **sterile saline** to remove dirt and debris.
- If needed, gently dab dry using sterile gauze.
- Apply **antibiotic ointment** (e.g., Neosporin).
- Cover with a **clean bandage** or non-stick gauze pad.
- If the patient is in visible pain or the rash is extensive, offer **oral pain medication** if within scope.

### Bumps & Bruises (Soft Tissue Injuries)
- Apply a **cold pack** to reduce swelling and discomfort.
  - Do **not** place ice directly on the skin—**wrap** it in cloth or gauze first.
- Elevate the affected limb if possible to further reduce swelling.
- Document any signs of abnormal pain, discoloration, or potential fracture.
