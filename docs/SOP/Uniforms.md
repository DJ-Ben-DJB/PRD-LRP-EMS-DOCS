# Uniforms

The EMS, being a out-ward facing Government department, enforces a strong ranked uniform policy. As an employee climbs the ranks within the department, they will receive new uniforms and insignia/epaulettes.

> all staff are not to carry any weapons, including licensed firearms when on shift (except non-lethal tasers, or via Pre-Authorisation under special circumstances). The EMS staff are employed to save people, not harm. This also reduces the risk for staff, as they will not be targeted by criminals for robbery.
