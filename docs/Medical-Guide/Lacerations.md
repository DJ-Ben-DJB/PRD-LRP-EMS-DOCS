# Lacerations (Cuts, Tears, or Deep Wounds)

---

## At Scene Care
*Quick steps to stop bleeding and protect the wound before the hospital.*

- **Clean the wound** using sterile saline to wash away dirt, bacteria, and debris.
- **Pack the wound** gently with sterile gauze to help stop bleeding and provide initial protection.
- **Apply a pressure bandage** firmly over the packed wound to control active bleeding and keep the gauze in place.
- If bleeding is heavy or doesn't slow, be ready to apply a tourniquet if it's a limb injury.

## At Hospital Care
*More in-depth wound care and possible surgery depending on how deep or severe the laceration is.*

- **Bring the patient into the OR or treatment room.**
- **Check vitals** (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level).
- **Give oxygen** if the patient is struggling to breathe or showing signs of shock.
- If the patient has **lost a lot of blood**, start an **O- blood transfusion** immediately.
- **Administer anesthesia** depending on the wound:
  - **Local** for small or surface wounds.
  - **General** if deep, multiple, or near sensitive areas.
- If the wound was **previously packed**, **remove the gauze carefully**.
- **Flush the wound again** with sterile saline to prevent infection and clear remaining debris or blood.
- If a **foreign object** (like glass or a knife) is still embedded, **remove it gently and steadily** to avoid further damage.
- **Use imaging (Sonogram, X-ray, or MRI)** if:
  - There's a chance of internal damage.
  - Bleeding continues with no visible source.
- If internal damage is found:
  - **Repair or suture injured organs, vessels, or muscle tissue** as needed.
- Once internals are managed:
  - **Suture the skin** around the entry (and exit) wounds.
  - **Apply antibiotic ointment** to reduce the risk of infection.
  - **Wrap the area in clean bandages**.
- **Move the patient to recovery** and monitor them for any complications.
- **Prescribe pain medications** if the patient is in pain or discomfort.
