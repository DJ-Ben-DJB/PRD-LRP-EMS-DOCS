# HIPAA Overview – Privacy & Disclosure Guidelines

---

## Permitted Uses & Disclosures of PHI

> **When uncertain, always escalate to a higher-ranking medical or administrative staff member.**

HIPAA permits, but does not require healthcare providers to use and disclose **Protected Health Information (PHI)** without patient authorisation in specific cases:

---

### Disclosure to the Individual
- Patients have the right to access their own PHI and request disclosures.
- Covered entities **must** comply with these requests when legally applicable.

---

### Treatment, Payment, and Healthcare Operations
- Sharing PHI is permitted when it directly supports:
  - Diagnosis or treatment
  - Insurance claims and billing
  - Internal hospital operations (e.g., quality review, case management)

---

### Informal Consent Situations
- A patient’s **verbal agreement** or **clearly implied consent** (e.g., nodding when asked) may allow disclosure of limited PHI.
- This is often used when family or friends are present during care.

---

### Incidental Disclosures
- Limited, unintentional sharing that occurs as a byproduct of permitted use (e.g., being overheard in a busy ER) is allowable under proper safeguards.

---

### Limited Data Sets (for Research & Public Health)
- PHI may be used in **de-identified form** for:
  - Public health reporting
  - Health system improvement
  - Research (under specific privacy agreements)

HIPAA allows disclosure **without consent** for **12 recognised national priorities**:

1. **When Required by Law**  
   (e.g., court orders, statutes, subpoenas)
2. **Public Health Activities**  
   (e.g., disease tracking, immunizations, FDA reporting)

4. **Health Oversight Activities**  
   (e.g., audits, investigations, licensure checks)
5. **Judicial & Administrative Proceedings**
6. **Law Enforcement Purposes**  
   Permitted under certain conditions:
   - Legal mandates (e.g., warrants, subpoenas)
   - Locating fugitives, suspects, or missing persons
   - Identifying crime victims (with proper requests)
   - Reporting criminal deaths or on-premises crime
   - Medical emergencies **off-premises** related to crime
7. **Deceased Individuals**  
   For ID, autopsy, or next-of-kin notification
8. **Organ, Eye, or Tissue Donation**
9. **Approved Research**  
   With proper privacy safeguards
10. **Serious Threat to Health or Safety**
11. **Essential Government Functions**  
    (e.g., military, national security, presidential protection)
12. **Workers’ Compensation Claims**

### Reminder for Roleplay:
- Avoid "powergaming" by withholding or disclosing patient info unrealistically.
- Use `/me` to reflect your character’s compliance with HIPAA (e.g., “/me Dr. Walker checks ID before releasing any documents”).
- Bring in senior staff or legal advisors ICly if a situation seems legally grey.
