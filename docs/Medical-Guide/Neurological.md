# Head Injury (Neurological)

This section covers two of the most common neurological incidents encountered in the field and hospital setting: **concussions** and **seizures**. Recognizing the signs early and administering proper assessments and care can prevent further complications.

## Seizures

Seizures are sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that can cause changes in behavior, movements, feelings, or consciousness.

### At Scene

- **Do not restrain** the patient or put anything in their mouth
- **Clear the area** around the patient to prevent injury
- Place a **soft object (jacket, towel)** under the head
- Turn the patient on their **side** if possible (recovery position)
- Time the seizure — if it exceeds **5 minutes**, this is a **medical emergency**
- Once the seizure ends:
  - Stay with the patient
  - Reassure them as they regain consciousness (postictal confusion is common)
  - Monitor airway, breathing, and vitals

### At Hospital - Post-Seizure

- Administer **oxygen** if oxygen saturation is low
- Check **blood glucose** (hypoglycemia can trigger seizures)
- Administer **anticonvulsants** if recurrent or seizure-prone (e.g., Phenytoin, Diazepam)
- Document:
  - Duration of seizure
  - Physical observations (jerking, incontinence, biting of tongue)
  - Consciousness and orientation post-episode

## Concussions (Mild Traumatic Brain Injury)

A concussion is caused by a blow to the head or a violent shaking of the head and body. It temporarily affects brain function and may not always involve loss of consciousness.

### Common Symptoms
- **Slurred speech** or delayed verbal response  
- **Headache**, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting  
- **Sensitivity** to light and sound  
- **Blurred vision** or ringing in ears (tinnitus)  
- **Behavioral changes**, such as irritability or confusion  
- **Imbalance** or coordination issues  
- **Numbness** or weakness in limbs (report immediately)

### Field Cognitive & Neuro Checks

Assess orientation, memory, and focus. These can be done on scene or shortly after arrival.

- Ask: “What **day**, **month**, **year**, and **day of the week** is it?”
- Ask them to spell the word **“world” backwards**
- Ask them to **memorize a short list of 3–5 objects or words**, and repeat them back
- Ask them to **repeat a sequence of numbers** you give them (e.g., 3-8-1-4)
- Ask them to **recite the months of the year in reverse order**
- Perform a **pupil response test** using a penlight:
  - Shine light into each eye; pupils should constrict quickly and evenly
  - **Delayed, unequal, or no response** may indicate increased intracranial pressure

### Treatment & Recovery

- **Rest and observation** are key; avoid cognitive or physical exertion in the first 24–48 hours
- Administer **Acetaminophen (Tylenol)** for headaches during the first 24 hours  
  - *Avoid NSAIDs* initially (like ibuprofen or aspirin), as they may increase bleeding risk
- After 24 hours, **Ibuprofen** can be introduced if symptoms persist
- Encourage the patient to:
  - **Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and stimulants**
  - **Limit screen time** and avoid loud or bright environments
  - **Sleep well** and report any worsening symptoms

*Discharge only if the patient is alert, oriented, and shows no signs of worsening. Otherwise, refer to neuro for observation or imaging.*

*Patients who experience their first seizure, multiple seizures, or seizures from trauma should be evaluated by neurology and may need imaging (CT or MRI).*
